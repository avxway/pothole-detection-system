# Pothole Detection System using YOLOv8 & Digital Image Processing

## Project Overview

This project presents a hybrid pothole detection system that combines **Digital Image Processing (DIP)** techniques with **YOLOv8 deep learning detection**.
It supports pothole identification from **images, videos, and live camera feed**, while also allowing visualization of each processing stage through a GUI.

The system demonstrates both traditional image processing pipelines and modern object detection in one unified application.

## Features

* Upload image or video for analysis
* Step-wise visualization of DIP pipeline stages
* Pothole detection on:

  * Images
  * Videos
  * Live camera feed
* Custom-trained YOLOv8 model support
* Modular and scalable project architecture
* GUI interface built with Tkinter

## Model Training (Google Colab)

The YOLOv8 model was trained on Google Colab using a custom pothole dataset.

Training workflow:

1. Dataset annotation and conversion to YOLO format
2. Training with Ultralytics YOLOv8
3. Exporting best weights (`best.pt`)
4. Downloading trained model for local inference

After training, place the model file here:

```
pothole-detection/models/best.pt
```
