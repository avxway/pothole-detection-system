# Pothole Detection System using YOLOv8 and Digital Image Processing

## Project Overview

This project detects potholes from images, videos, and live camera feed using a hybrid approach:

* Digital Image Processing pipeline (Enhancement → Restoration → Morphology → Segmentation)
* Deep Learning detection using YOLOv8
* GUI built with Tkinter for interactive testing

The system allows users to visualize each processing phase and run real-time pothole detection.

---

## Features

* Upload image or video for testing
* Step-by-step DIP processing visualization
* Pothole detection on:

  * Images
  * Videos
  * Live camera feed
* YOLOv8 custom trained model support
* Modular project architecture

---

## Model Training (Google Colab)

The YOLOv8 model was trained on Google Colab using a custom pothole dataset.

Training steps included:

* Dataset preparation in YOLO format
* Training using Ultralytics YOLOv8
* Exporting best weights (`best.pt`)
* Downloading the model for local inference

After training, place the model file here:

```
pothole-detection/models/best.pt
```
